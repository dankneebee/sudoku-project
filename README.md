# sudokuproject
This is a simple Sudoku game prototype in Java. Itâ€™s a prototype because as of the moment it does not generate different grids, currently it has one already solved and hardcoded into the grid puzzle. A future potential feature would be change of difficulty, where more cells are empty and it is more challenging to solve. Technologies used: Java AWT, Java Swing, Java AWT Color and Font and Java SWING JTextField for the GUI of the application, Java AWT Event, customized JTextField, JPanel and JFrame.
The project was made for an assignment for COS230 Java Programming class.
